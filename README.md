Abstract: "Water distribution in municipalities involves various
challenges, such as maintenance of pipelines, pressure and flow
control, water quality monitoring, among others. In this sense,
measuring the flow and pressure of a system is a key issue for optimizing water distribution in cities. Therefore, this information
is important to ensure that water is delivered with quality and in
adequate quantity to consumers. With the advent of technology,
some advanced solutions have been proposed in the literature to
address these challenges, such as hydraulic modeling software,
intelligent sensors, and automated control systems. Among these,
one of the most commonly used techniques to increase system
efficiency is wireless sensor networks. However, monitoring in
a wide coverage area, such as metropolises, becomes difficult
to implement, involving high costs and infeasibility of largescale sensor installation. Therefore, applications involving IoT
(Internet of Things) have been proposed as a low-cost and low
energy consumption alternative. Thus, this article describes the
steps, challenges, and solutions necessary for the development
of a self-sufficient IoT application aimed at monitoring pressure
and flow in a water supply network."
